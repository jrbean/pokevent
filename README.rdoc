== Pokévent!

Pokévent is a relatively simple event organization app I use to work on Rails
basics. It's Pokémon themed to make a simple app much more entertaining to work
on.

== Things I'm working on:

* More interesting views.

* Stripe integration (Lavender Town isn't a cheap place)

== In the further future:

* An API to more easily swap in a non-Poké front-end.

* Improved authorization scopes for event organizers and attendees

* Tests!
